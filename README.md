# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing customer behavior and historical data, the model identifies which customers are at risk of leaving a business.
🔧 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models

🚀 Key Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Implementation of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

📈 Goal:
Helping businesses retain customers by proactively identifying those who are likely to churn.
